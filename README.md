# Runtime editable Landscape

The runtime editable Landscape is a Unreal Engine 5 Plugin that aims to make Landscape editable at runtime. I developed it for the city builder [BootyIsland](https://bootyisland.itch.io/bootyisland), I'm currently working on.

## Features

* Edit the height of the landscape at runtime
* Edit vertex colors at runtime

## State of development

At the moment this plugin is still in prototyping phase. There is some functionality available, but I do not recommend using it for your own project, yet.

### TODOs

* Copy material from original landscape
* Adjust foliage
* Optimize Performance
* Clean up code
